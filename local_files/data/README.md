# Data used for training

Train and test datasets can be downloaded directly through my epfl [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z-wKuSKlAQR0J1MdXDZEp2QDFyhMxOlQ?usp=share_link). 
They were too big to push them into my repo.

Simply drag and drop the files you just downloaded, it will be well-structured. This folder will contain each dataset 
used to train or test the DnCNN models. Feel free to create your personal reduced or mixed dataset using the 
`mixed_dataset.ipynb` notebook. It will automatically create these datasets.
